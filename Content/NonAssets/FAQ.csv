Scoring_CustomGameModes_Header,Custom Game Modes
Scoring_CustomGameModes_1,Scores for custom game modes are specific to each custom game mode name and each song.
Scoring_General_Header,General Scoring Information
Scoring_General_1,"""Specific to each song"" means that the game considers a song equal to another if it has the same Song Title. If you care about tracking your consistency for a given song, make sure to always use the same song title."
Scoring_General_2,"When playing a song from a file, the song title is saved from metadata if possible, but otherwise uses the filename."
Scoring_Hit_Header,Hit Damage Type Scoring
Scoring_Hit_1,"Players recieve the maximum score for successfully hitting the target +- 0.05s from the Spawn Beat Delay. The score recieved drops off linearly from the peak based on the time away from the peak color, down a minimum of half of the max score. If a target expires before being hit, no score is awarded."
Scoring_Hit_2,"The theoretical maximum score for any game mode in this category is 100,000."
Scoring_Hit_3,The maximum score for any given target is based on dividing the maximum total score by how many targets could spawn during the length of song (Maximum total score / (Song Length / Target Spawn Cooldown)).
Scoring_Tracking_Header,Tracking Damage Type Scoring
Scoring_Tracking_1,Tracking-based Damage Type game modes grant one point of score per game tick that the player's crosshair is on the target. BeatTrack uses this.
Scoring_Tracking_2,Tracking-based Damage Type game modes calculate accuracy by taking the total server ticks with crosshair on target divided by total server ticks where a target was damageable.
Scoring_StandardGameModes_Header,Default Game Modes
Scoring_StandardGameModes_1,"Scores for every default/standard game mode are specific to each game mode, each song, and each difficulty."

TLC_Spawn_Header,Target Spawning
TLC_Activation_Header,Target Activation
TLC_Deactivation_Header,Target Deactivation
TLC_Destruction_Header,Target Destruction
TLC_Spawn_1,"Targets can either be spawned before the game mode starts (for persistant targets that aren't permanantly destroyed), or be spawned during the game mode."
TLC_Spawn_2,The number of targets spawned can be controlled using:
TLC_Activation_1,A target is considered to be activated when it's lifetime timer is ticking. It will be activated until any Deactivation Conditions are met.
TLC_Activation_3,The number of targets activated can be controlled using:
TLC_Activation_2,"The Target Activation Selection Policy only effects game modes using a Target Distribution Policy ""Grid""."
TLC_Activation_Response_Header,Activation Response
TLC_Activation_Response_1,An activation response describes what a target does when it is activated. Multiple can be selected.
TLC_Activation_Response_2,"Most of the time, you will want ""Remove Immunity"" selected if immunity is applied on spawn."
TLC_Activation_Response_3,The number of targets activated can be controlled using:
TLC_Activation_Response_4,The Target Activation Selection Policy only applies to modes using a Target Distribution Policy of Grid.
TLC_Deactivation_1,"A target is deactivated according to ""Target Deactivation Conditions"". Multiple can be selected, but some will override others."
TLC_Deactivation_Response_Header,Deactivation Response
TLC_Deactivation_Response_1,"A deactivation response describes what a target does once it is no longer activated, after a deactivation condition has been met. Multiple can be selected."
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_Header,Deactivation Condition
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_1,A deactivation condition describes the criteria that needs to be met for the target to enter the deactivated state. Multiple can be selected.
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_2,"""Persistant"" targets never deactivate. An example mode using this is BeatTrack, where the target is always damageable. Persistant targets are the only kind that can respond to additional activations while activated."
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_3,"""On Any External Damage Taken"" will deactivate a target the moment it recieves any amount of damage, regardless of its max health."
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_4,"""On Experation"" will deactivate a target after the ""Target Maximum Lifespan"" has expired."
TLC_Destruction_Condition_1,A destruction condition describes when a target should be permanently destroyed. Multiple can be selected.
TLC_Destruction_Condition_2,"""Persistant"" targets are never destroyed. BeatGrid spawns all its targets before the game mode starts and uses this condition."
TLC_Destruction_Condition_3,"""On Health Reached Zero"" will destroy a target once it has received its max health in damage. This could be from a combination of player inflicted damage and ""Expiration Health Penalty"" damage."
TLC_Destruction_Condition_4,"""On Deactivation"" will destroy a target once any deactivation conditions are met."
TLC_Destruction_Condition_Header,Destruction Condition
Scaling_Title,Changing the target scale can be accomplished in a number of ways:
Scaling_1,Spawn scale: The Consecutive Target Scale Policy and its values.
Scaling_1_1,"Can also be applied to subsequent target activations with the ""Apply Consecutive Target Scale"" Target Activation Response."
Scaling_2,"Smooth change over lifetime: ""Apply Lifetime Target Scaling"" Target Activation Response and ""Lifetime Target Scaling Multiplier""."
Scaling_3,"Change on deactivation: ""Apply Deactivated Target Scale Multiplier"" Target Deactivation Response and the ""Deactivated Target Scale Multiplier""."
Scaling_4,"Reset to spawn scale on deactivation: ""Reset Scale To Spawned Scale"" Target Deactivation Response."
Scaling_5,"Reset to activated scale on deactivation: ""Reset Scale To Activated Scale"" Target Deactivation Response."
Velocity_Title,Changing the target velocity can be accomplished in a number of ways:
Velocity_5,"All of these follow the Moving Target Direction Mode, which must be set to something other than ""None"" to have an effect."
Velocity_1,"Apply Velocity On Spawn: Applies the Spawned Target Velocity immediately when spawned, without requiring activation."
Velocity_2,"""Change Velocity"" Target Activation Response"
Velocity_3,"""Change Velocity"" Target Deactivation Response"
TLC_Activation_4,A target is always activated in response to the AudioAnalyzer. It cannot be activated again until it is deactivated.
AA_1,The analyzer keeps a rolling average of the frequency values across multiple channels.
AA_2,"When it detects a change in frequency that is very different from the current rolling average, targets are spawned or activated, depending on the game mode settings."
AA_3, You can change how sensitive the analyzer is to frequency changes for each channel using the settings menu.
AA_4,"When you provide the game with a song file, it analyzes a separate audio track from the one you actually hear."
AA_5,"This offset allows the game to account for reaction time. The image below shows an example, using 250 milliseconds for reaction time."
AA_6,"The idea is to destroy the target at the bright green color. Reaction time is one of the settings changed across difficulties in default game modes, but can customized using the Spawn Beat Delay setting in custom modes."
