Scoring_CustomGameModes_Header,"Custom Game Modes"
Scoring_CustomGameModes_1,"Scores for custom game modes are specific to each custom game mode name and each song."
Scoring_General_Header,"General Scoring Information"
Scoring_General_1,"""Specific to each song"" means that the game considers a song equal to another if it has the same Song Title. If you care about tracking your consistency for a given song, make sure to always use the same song title."
Scoring_General_2,"When playing a song from a file, the song title is saved from metadata if possible, but otherwise uses the filename."
Scoring_Hit_Header,"Hit Damage Type Scoring"
Scoring_Hit_1,"Players recieve the maximum score for successfully hitting the target +- 0.05s from the Spawn Beat Delay. The score recieved drops off linearly from the peak based on the time away from the peak color, down a minimum of half of the max score. If a target expires before being hit, no score is awarded."
Scoring_Hit_2,"The theoretical maximum score for any game mode in this category is 100,000."
Scoring_Hit_3,"The maximum score for any given target is based on dividing the maximum total score by how many targets could spawn during the length of song (Maximum total score / (Song Length / Target Spawn Cooldown))."
Scoring_Tracking_Header,"Tracking Damage Type Scoring"
Scoring_Tracking_1,"Tracking-based Damage Type game modes grant one point of score per game tick that the player's crosshair is on the target. BeatTrack uses this."
Scoring_Tracking_2,"Tracking-based Damage Type game modes calculate accuracy by taking the total server ticks with crosshair on target divided by total server ticks where a target was damageable."
Scoring_StandardGameModes_Header,"Default Game Modes"
Scoring_StandardGameModes_1,"Scores for every default/standard game mode are specific to each game mode, each song, and each difficulty."

TLC_Deactivation_Header,"Target Deactivation"
TLC_Destruction_Header,"Target Destruction"
TLC_Spawn_1,"Targets can either be spawned before the game mode starts (for persistant targets that aren't permanantly destroyed), or be spawned during the game mode."
TLC_Spawn_2,"The number of targets spawned can be controlled using ""Number of Targets to Spawn Upfront"" and ""Number of Targets to Spawn at Runtime""."
TLC_Activation_1,"A target is considered to be activated when it can be damaged. It will be activated until any Deactivation Conditions are met."
TLC_Activation_2,"A target is always activated in response to the AudioAnalyzer. It cannot be activated again until it is deactivated."
TLC_Activation_Response_Header,"Activation Response"
TLC_Activation_Response_1,"An activation response describes what a target does when it is activated. Multiple can be selected."
TLC_Activation_Response_2,"Most of the time, you will want ""Remove Immunity"" selected if immunity is applied on spawn."
TLC_Activation_Response_3,"""Change Direction"" will set change the direction the target is traveling towards. ""Move Targets"" must be checked for this to have an effect."
TLC_Activation_Response_4,"""Change Scale"" will set the target scale to a new value that depends on the ""Consecutive Target Scale Policy""."
TLC_Activation_Response_5,"""Change Velocity"" will apply a new velocity to the target between ""Min Target Speed"" and ""Max Target Speed""."
TLC_Deactivation_1,"A target is deactivated according to ""Target Deactivation Conditions"". Multiple can be selected, but some will override others."
TLC_Deactivation_Response_Header,"Deactivation Response"
TLC_Deactivation_Response_1,"A deactivation response describes what a target does once it is no longer activated, after a deactivation condition has been met. Most of these are self-explanatory, but I'll discuss a few that could trip people up."
TLC_Deactivation_Response_2,"""Apply Deactivated Target Scale Multiplier"" will set the target scale to its current scale multiplied by ""Deactivated Target Scale Multiplier""."
TLC_Deactivation_Response_3,"""Reset Scale"" will reset the target scale back to the scale it was activated with."
TLC_Deactivation_Response_4,"""Reset Position"" will reset the target position back to the position it was activated at. Useful for moving targets."
TLC_Deactivation_Response_5,"""Shrink Quick Grow Slow"" shrinks the target and slowly returns it to the scale it was activated with. Used in BeatGrid."
TLC_Deactivation_Response_6,"""Destroy"" permanently destroys the target. Usually don't use this."
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_Header,"Deactivation Condition"
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_1,"A deactivation condition describes the criteria that needs to be met for the target to enter the deactivated state. Multiple can be selected."
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_2,"""Persistant"" targets never deactivate. An example mode using this is BeatTrack, where the target is always damageable. Persistant targets are the only kind that can respond to additional activations while activated."
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_3,"""On Any External Damage Taken"" will deactivate a target the moment it recieves any amount of damage, regardless of its max health."
TLC_Deactivation_Condition_4,"""On Experation"" will deactivate a target after the ""Target Maximum Lifespan"" has expired."
TLC_Destruction_Condition_1,A destruction condition describes when a target should be permanently destroyed. Multiple can be selected.
TLC_Destruction_Condition_2,"""Persistant"" targets are never destroyed. BeatGrid spawns all its targets before the game mode starts and uses this condition."
TLC_Destruction_Condition_3,"""On Health Reached Zero"" will destroy a target once it has received its max health in damage. This could be from a combination of player inflicted damage and ""Expiration Health Penalty"" damage."
TLC_Destruction_Condition_4,"""On Deactivation"" will destroy a target once any deactivation conditions are met."
