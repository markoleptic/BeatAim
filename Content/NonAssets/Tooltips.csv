Key,SourceString
BaseGameMode,"The gamemode to base the custom game mode off of. For example, if you want targets in a grid, this needs to be set to BeatGrid."
GameModeTemplate,See what settings the default game modes use to fine tune your custom game mode.
CustomGameModeName,The name to save your custom game mode as.
GameModeDifficulty,"Useful for seeing what settings the default game modes use, but custom game modes have no difficulty by default."
SpawnBeatDelay,Time between initial spawning of the target (white) and the beat (bright green). This is basically anticipated reaction time.
Lifespan,"How long the target will live, even if not shot. This doesn't apply to BeatTrack."
TargetSpawnCD,"Sets the minimum time between target spawns. This doesn't guarantee a target will spawn at this rate, only that it is possible if there are beats."
HeadshotHeight,"If checked, the targests will only spawn at headshot height."
FloorDistance,Distance from floor to bottom of the spawn area.
MinDistance,The minimum distance between the edges of targets. Choosing a high value can cause the game to skip target spawns if it doesn't find room for it.
SpreadType,"There are two types of spread that control how far the targets can spawn from the center of the spawn area. Dynamic spread lowers the spawn area based on consecutive targets hit, while static spread does not change the spawn area."
ConstantTargetScale,"If checked, the scale/size of the target will remain constant throughout the game mode."
DynamicTargetScale,"Similar to dynamic spread, the targets gradually shrink from Max Target scale to Min Target scale based on consecutive targets hit."
BeatGridEvenSpacing,Evenly distributes the targets so that the horizontal and vertical distance between targets is the same.
BeatGridAdjacentOnly,"By default, adjacent-only will only activate a target that was adjacent/beside a previously activated target. Completely random will choose a target in the grid at random."
BeatGridNumTargets,The number of targets that are spawned at the beginning.
BeatTrackConstantSpeed,"If checked, the speed of the target will remain constant throughout the game mode."
ForwardSpread,"If checked, the targets will move forward towards the player by ForwardDistance over the maximum target lifespan."
PlaybackAudio,"If checked, the audio from the Input Audio Device will playback to the Output Audio Device. Check  this box if you aren't routing your Input Audio Device to your desktop sound."
EnableAI,"If checked, the game will spawn targets according to reinforcment learning algorithms. This should expose you to your weaknesses more often."
Alpha,The alpha value. How quickly the reinforcement learning agent will learn.
Epsilon,"The epsilon value. A value of 1 will result in only choosing random values (explore), while a value of zero will result in only choosing locations where your accuracy is lowest."
Gamma,The gamma value. How much to value future rewards vs immediate rewards
BeatGrid_SuggestStart,Not enough space! Change one or more of the following:
BeatGrid_NumHorizontalSuggest,Number of Horizontal Targets <=
BeatGrid_NumVerticalSuggest,Number of Vertical Targets to <=
BeatGrid_ScaleSuggest,Maximum Target Scale to <=
BeatGrid_HorizontalSpacingSuggest,Horizontal Spacing to <=
BeatGrid_VerticalSpacingSuggest,Vertical Spacing to <=
LifetimeTargetScale,"Whether to change the target size over its lifetime, or not at all."
LifetimeTargetScale_Grow,Grow: Change the target scale from its current to its maximum scale over its lifetime.
LifetimeTargetScale_Shrink,Shrink: Change the target scale from its current to its minimum scale over its lifetime.
